# cplx Parametric Part Syntax

cplx Parts are C# classes, and can be parameterized by declaring a constructor with parameters.

## Part Variants using class Constructors

Declare a constructor
Assign P/N, Revision and CommonName through properties => these takes precedence over the attributes


Must now asign value to usages

Best practices
- Must Ensure PN form/fit/function uniqueness
- Encourage instantiation as type of used item

## Declaring Enumerables

Enumerables work.

## Part Alternatives

Use alternatives to produces part variants at part instantiation
