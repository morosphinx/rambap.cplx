### The Concept Modules

Concepts define calculations of instance properties. Each concept process the the Part class, properties[^1], components, and attributes to produce the instance data.

[^1]:Properties and attributes are not owned by a specific concept. For exemple, the 'Cost' property is defined by the CostConcept, but other concepts may rely on the 'Cost' part property

Concept could represent
- [extensive properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties), such as the aggregated mass, or cost, or power consumption of the entire component tree
- General information about a Part, such as Manufacturer or Supplier info.
- Qualitative information deduced from its composition and properties, such as normative status.
